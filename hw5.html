				The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are both designed to be given in a two-dose series -- the Pfizer vaccine three
				weeks apart and Moderna's four weeks apart. There's been discussion about whether it might be OK to give these
				vaccines as a single dose, or to extend the time between doses so more people can get their first vaccine, and
				thus get at least some protection.</p>

				<p> His arrival came days after a deadly winter storm devastated Texas, leaving millions without power and water
				and in subfreezing temperatures for multiple days. As Biden traveled across Houston, state lawmakers were holding
				their second day of committee hearings in Austin to get to the bottom of the catastrophe. On Thursday, committee
				members spent over 12 hours grilling the state's public regulators and energy grid officials over the crisis.</p>
			
				<h4> Title </h4>

				prescribing specific proposals for Texas but noted the state made the decision to have its own grid and that
				meant that it lacked the "kind of backup in terms of supply or generation capability that they needed to have
				in this crisis."</p>
